# Testing Log
## Phase 1 — Initial Setup

### What I tested

Just checked that Python and TensorFlow installed properly and the hello world script runs.

### Tests

| # | What I tried | Type | Expected | Actual | Pass? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run app.py | Normal | Prints "Hello World" | It printed it | Yes |
| 2 | Import tensorflow in Python shell | Normal | No errors | Imported fine, version 2.15.0 | Yes |
| 3 | Import numpy | Normal | No errors | Imported fine | Yes |

### Bugs found

None — there's nothing to break yet. Just making sure my environment works before I start building stuff.
